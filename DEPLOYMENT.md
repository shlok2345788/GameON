# GameOn Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Routing Configuration
- ✅ Removed duplicate router setup (AppRouter.jsx)
- ✅ Simplified main.jsx to use App.jsx directly
- ✅ App.jsx now handles all routing with proper React Router v7 configuration

### 2. Vite Configuration
- ✅ Added proper build configuration for production
- ✅ Configured history API fallback for SPA routing
- ✅ Added code splitting for better performance
- ✅ Set proper base path and output directory

### 3. Deployment Files
- ✅ Created `_redirects` file for Netlify deployment
- ✅ Created `vercel.json` for Vercel deployment
- ✅ Added serve script for local testing

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Netlify
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Upload the `dist` folder to Netlify
3. The `_redirects` file will handle SPA routing

### Option 2: Vercel
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set output directory: `dist`
4. The `vercel.json` file will handle SPA routing

### Option 3: Manual Server Deployment
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Upload the `dist` folder to your web server
3. Configure your web server to serve `index.html` for all routes

## Local Testing
- Development: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build`
- Preview built version: `npm run preview`

## Key Changes Made

1. **vite.config.js**: Added comprehensive build and server configuration

## Backend Deployment Notes
- Make sure to update API endpoints in your frontend to point to your deployed backend
- Update CORS settings in your backend to allow your frontend domain
- Set proper environment variables for production

The routing issues have been resolved and your app should now deploy successfully!
